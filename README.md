You can use `Express.js` to create create a web server, which:

1. serves static HTML files (usually not what you'd use `Express.js` for)
2. constitutes a JSON API (so that you can connect from a frontend, such as a React application)
3. renders templates where you can insert data dynamically (so that you can create a dynamic web application rather than just a static website)
